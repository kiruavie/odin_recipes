    <h3>
      Cacio e pepe is a simple, classic Roman pasta dish. This easy vegan recipe
      swaps the cheese for cashew butter, miso, and nutritional yeast for a
      satisfying supper.
    </h3>

    <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>12 ounces bucatini pasta</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
      <li>
        1 teaspoon fresh, coarsely ground black pepper, plus more to taste
      </li>
      <li>
        1/3 cup unsweetened cashew butter (raw and untoasted, if possible)
      </li>
      <li>1/4 cup nutritional yeast</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons miso</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the pasta and
        salt. Cook until al dente (according to the package directions). Reserve
        1 1/2 cups of pasta water and drain the pasta in a colander.
      </li>
      <li>
        Toast the black pepper: Meanwhile, add the coarsely ground pepper to a
        large, deep skillet over medium-low heat and toast until fragrant, about
        a minute. Transfer the pepper to a medium bowl. You’ll add the pasta
        back to this skillet, so make sure it is large enough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the sauce: Add the cashew butter, nutritional yeast, and miso to
        the bowl with the pepper. While whisking, slowly pour in 1 cup of the
        reserved, hot pasta water into the cashew butter mixture. Whisk until
        creamy and well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine and serve: Add the drained pasta and sauce to the skillet over
        medium-low heat. Stir and toss constantly until the sauce thickens—this
        may take a few minutes. If this sauce becomes too thick, add more pasta
        water, a small splash at a time. Season with salt to taste and garnish
        with more pepper. Serve immediately. Vegan cacio e pepe is best served
        fresh. Any leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the
        fridge for up to 3 days. To reheat, add a splash of water or nondairy
        milk and place in a skillet over medium heat and cook until warmed
        through.
